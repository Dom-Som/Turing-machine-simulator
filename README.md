# Turing Machine Simulator (C++)

This project is a **Turing Machine simulator** written in C++ that supports both **1-tape and 2-tape machines**. It executes machine logic defined in a structured text file, simulates head movement, and outputs tape states live in the console.

Ideal for educational use and demonstration of Turing-complete logic.
